# Negative frequency-dependent selection in post-vaccine pneumococcal population

This repository contains resources to replicate the parameter inference experiments reported by Corander et al. [1]. 
The inference procedure is implemented with ELFI [2] in the attached notebook.

The notebook is tested with Python 3.5 and ELFI v. 0.7.4.

## Files and folders

- **code/simulator/**
  This folder contains the multilocus NFDS simulator.
- **code/utils.py**
  Contais operations which are used in parameter inference with ELFI and in visualisation.
- **data/**
  This folder contains the observed data.
- **inference.ipynb**
  Jupyter notebook defining the ELFI model and running the inference.
